      <li>It's a new way to be creative</li>
      <li>People now think I'm really smart</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Things people said when I told them I was learning how to code.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Good luck</li>
    <li>That's really hard</li>
    <li>WOW, really?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The first thing I've learned about coding
     it can be really frustrating and make you want
     to throw your computer.</P>
